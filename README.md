Weather Dashboard

The OpenWeather API was used to create a dashboard that shows the weather forecast for different cities. This weather dashboard was created to assist users in viewing current weather conditions in their city and other cities, as well as the forecast for the following five days.

When a user searches for a location, the current weather and a 5-day forecast are displayed. Temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV Index, and an easy-to-understand weather indicator are all included in the weather information. The UV index is color-coded to make it easier for consumers to understand the value.
